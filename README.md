# nfl_prediction_model
Building out different models to accurately predict various outcomes in any given NFL game


The vision of this project would be to continuously create new models and variations of existing models that predict the overall outcome of NFL games each week. A database would be used to track model parameters(features, model types, etc.) and historical predictions/outcomes. Finally a web application would also be created to clearly see which models are performing best week over week as the NFL season progresses throughout the year.
